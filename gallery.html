        <p>From the moment I met Patrick in his showroom, I had a good feeling about having him do my kitchen remodel. After picking out the cabinets, countertop, backsplash, hardware, sink (all was done at his showroom, which was so convenient), the job was started. I was dreading the disruption but honestly, I was amazed at how organized the workers were and how clean they kept everything. They arrived on time every morning and were very respectful of my home and surroundings. I would highly recommend Keane's!! A BIG Thank You to Patrick, Eddie, Grace, Patricia, Mario, Freddie, Nestor. My kitchen turned out beautiful!!</p>

        <p>Very pleased with the kitchen renovation. The team at Keane Kitchens was fantastic to work with. The staff was on-time, friendly and professional. Very accommodating. As I understand it, many of the team have been with the company for many years. Patrick was always available and responsive to questions that came up during the process. I would gladly recommend this company to anyone looking for a solid kitchen improvement contractor on the peninsula.</p>

        <p>We were hesitant to remodel our kitchen because of the stress and mess we knew would come with the process. But, we were pleasantly surprised. Our experience with Patrick Keane of Keane Kitchens was wonderful. Also, Grace in the showroom was always helpful and friendly. We now have a beautiful, new kitchen, finished at the 6-week projected time. Patrick was always available by cell phone for any concerns or questions. The workers were friendly, on time, excellent at their craft, and very accommodating. At the end of the day, the work site was left clean. Thank you Patrick, Grace, and all the workers for a job well done!</p>
